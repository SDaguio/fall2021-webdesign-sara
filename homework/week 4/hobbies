<title>5D diamond painting</title>

<h3>What it is all about</h3>
\f0\fs24 \cf0 My name is Sara Daguio and one of my favorite hobbies is 5D diamond painting. I really enjoy this activity because it is relaxing and it gives me time to not think but be in the present moment. I started making 5D diamond paintings like 2 years ago, during the first wave of the pandemic. I found it was a great way to deal with being in lock down.\
\
There are two forms of 5D diamond painting. One form of 5D diamond painting is to do it free style by creating your own colorful designs on a sticky canvas. The second form are paint by number kits, which means the designs are pre-made and it comes with all colors you need. You just have to match the number on the sticky canvas to the corrosponding color. You have s stylus pen that you stick the tip into this pink\
sticky stuff called clay. The clay allows you to pick up these little multi-faceted beads which are called drills. Then the drills are placed on the sticky canvas one by one. A completed project usually takes many hours to complete.\
